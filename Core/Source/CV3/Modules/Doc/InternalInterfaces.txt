This document describes the structure of the internal observer/interfaces
within CV3.

Interfaces that could be derived by any module, e.g LocationModuleObserver is
located in Modules/include. 

Module specific interfaces (interfaces that are derived by a specific module)
are located in the modules interface folder, e.g in LocationModule/interface,
the LocationProvider interface can be found. LocationModule derives from this
interface and no other module should be able to do that.

The module specific interfaces are meant to give a specific view/interface of a
module. Instead of returning the LocationModule, which then would open up for
use of any public function in LocationModule, we return a derived interface to
the module.

CoreMain has some specific interfaces in CoreMain/interface. These are:
- ModuleDataInterfaceProvider.h
- ModuleObserverInterfaceProvider.h

These interfaces should be derived by the main class for CV3, all modules will
then be able to get access to other modules (interfaces) through the derived
functions in the above provider interfaces. E.g ModuleObserverInterfaceProvider
contains one function for returning the ModuleObserverInterface which is
actually a specific derived module like the LocationModule (used when
registering a module as an observer to the LocationModule).
